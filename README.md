# Small Python Projects

Projects included:
- Sierpinski triangle generator
- grade calculator
- Mandelbrot set generator

---
## Grade calculator

What is it?
- python application
- Tkinter library used for gui
- text in polish 

What it does?
- choose grade (4th, 5th, 6th)
- subjects list depends on chosen grade
- enter grades for all subjects and assessment of behavior
- application computes average grade and checks if it is diploma with honors

## Sierpinski triangle generator

What is it?
- python application
- operations on images

What it does?
- program creates sierpinski triangle from test image and saves it in file
- sierpinski triangle is a fractal with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles
- you can set amout of iterations of application
- at some point image becomes completely white - size of elements is smaller than one pixel, so they are not shown

## Mandelbrot set generator

What is it?
- python application
- Matplotlib and NumPy libraries used for creating plot
- Tkinter library used for gui

What it does?
- program creates a plot with mandelbrot set
- the Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f{c}(z)=z^{2}+c does not diverge when iterated from z=0
- left click on plot for zoom in
- right click on plot for zoom out
- you can set number of calculation points (side of square array), max iteration number for each calculation point, and zoom factor
- calculation time depends on number of points on plot
